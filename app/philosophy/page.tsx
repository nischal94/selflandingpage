        <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4">Work as Play</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Nischal chose entrepreneurship to pursue creative fulfillment rather than conventional career paths. His guiding principle: "I always wanted to do things where I enjoy the work so much that it seems like play."
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          This perspective reflects a deep belief that meaningful work should align with personal passion rather than purely financial goals. When work becomes indistinguishable from play, it ceases to be a burden and becomes a source of joy and continuous motivation.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4">Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Inspired by design legends like Dieter Rams and Jony Ive, Nischal embraces minimalism and functional beauty. Every Svenklas product embodies the principle that good design is both aesthetically pleasing and purposeful.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          The brand's commitment to natural materials isn't just an environmental choice—it's an aesthetic one. Nischal believes that sustainable materials can and should be beautiful, luxurious, and desirable.

        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Nischal identifies several key factors that contribute to entrepreneurial success: unwavering optimism, patience through challenges, genuine passion for the work, and sustained persistence that outlasts competitors' capacity.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          He emphasizes incremental progress: "Incremental changes to any aspect of life...there is no limit to where you can reach." Small, consistent improvements compound over time to create extraordinary results.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4">Connection to Nature</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Nischal credits his Dehradun upbringing and love of nature with providing stress resilience and creative clarity. Outdoor activities remain essential to his well-being and serve as a constant source of inspiration.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          This deep connection to nature informs not just his personal life but the entire ethos of Svenklas—creating products that honor the natural world rather than exploit it.
