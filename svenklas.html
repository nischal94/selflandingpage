                <p class="content-text">
                    In 2019, Nischal Sharma and Nikhil Sharma founded Svenklas with an initial investment of Rs 5 lakh. The duo met in Gurugram in 2017 while working on a design project at a marketing firm called Ebee Global. United by their shared vision for sustainable design, they launched the brand to develop thoughtful products using plant-based natural materials.
